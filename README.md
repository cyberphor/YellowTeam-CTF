## Who is it for?
* Short answer: anyone who wants to learn how to code. 

## How do I use it?
1. First, read and follow the instructions in "[Getting Setup](/_misc/getting_setup.md)."
2. Then, pick a language:
    * [PowerShell](PowerShell/README.md)
    * [Python](/Python/README.md)
3. Next, change directories to it using: `cd ./Python/`
4. Finally, follow the instructions to progress through each level. 

## What will I learn?
You will learn the following concepts that are fundamental to every computer programming language:
* Output
* Input
* Arithmetic 
* Conditionals
